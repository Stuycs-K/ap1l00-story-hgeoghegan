Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no elephant
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on water bottles, I thought I would peruse about
a little and see the whimsical part of the whale. It is a way I have of driving off the
tarantulas and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the prospects;
whenever it is a cold, humid November in my abode; whenever I find myself involuntarily
asphyxiate before coffin <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>, and bringing up the rear of every <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> off—then, I account it high time to get to <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> with me.
